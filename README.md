# openapi2asciidoc
Simple Ruby script to create asciidoc format from a yaml/json openapi 3.0 file

Usage: openapi2asciidoc _myapis.yaml_ > _myapis.adoc_

This is a script I hacked together in an afternoon, so I have zero guarantees.  But it seems to work well enough for the example from https://editor.swagger.io/.

Use https://asciidoctor.org/ to convert the asciidoc file into html or pdf.
